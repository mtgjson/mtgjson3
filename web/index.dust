		<h2>Booster Field<a href="#top">(back to top)</a></h2>
		<p>The 'booster' key is present for each set that has physical boosters (so not present for box sets, duel decks, digital masters editions, etc.)<br>
		<br>
		It is an array containing one item per card in the booster. Thus the array length is how many cards are in a booster.<br>
		<br>
		Each item in the array is either a string representing the type of booster card or an array of strings representing possible types for that booster card.<br>
		<br>
		For example, 'Magic 2013' contains 1 land, 1 marketing card, 10 commons, 3 uncommons and 1 rare or mythic rare:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript">    {~lb}
          "name" : "Magic 2013",
       "booster" : [ "land",
                     "marketing",
                     "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common",
                     "uncommon", "uncommon", "uncommon",
                     ["rare", "mythic rare"]
                   ]
    {~rb}</code></pre>
		<p><br>
		The common booster card types are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>common</li>
			<li>uncommon</li>
			<li>rare</li>
			<li>mythic rare</li>
			<li>land</li>
			<li>marketing</li>
			<li>checklist</li>
			<li>double faced</li>
		</ul>
		<p><br>The Time Spiral block has some additional types:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>timeshifted common</li>
			<li>timeshifted uncommon</li>
			<li>timeshifted rare</li>
			<li>timeshifted purple</li>
		</ul>
		<p><br>
		Note that the 'Time Spiral "Timeshifted"' set does not have a booster field. This 'set' was actually a subset of the 'Time Spiral' set and its cards are the 'timeshifted purple' booster card type mentioned above.<br>
		<br>
		The "Magic: The Gathering—Conspiracy" expansion has an additional "draft-matters" type which can either be a "Conspiracy" type card or a card that affects drafting.<br>
		<br>
		The "Vintage Masters" set has one slot that can contain either a power nine card or a guaranteed foil, so it has additional types "power nine" and "foil".<br>
		<br>
		Foils are not explictily mentioned, except for 'Modern Masters' where a slot is guaranteed a foil. So that set has four additional possible booster card types: foil common, foil uncommon, foil rare and foil mythic rare<br>
		<br>
		Any card marked as "starter" : true should be exempted from any booster generation as these cards were only available in boxed sets and not in boosters.<br>

		<h2>Cards<a href="#top">(back to top)</a></h2>
		<p>The cards value is an Array of cards, each being a JSON object with key/value pairs. Below you will find a table detailing each key.<br>
		<br>
		I order the cards first by 'name', then by 'imageName' and finally by 'number'<br>
		<br>
		If a value would be empty (such as manaCost for Basic Lands), then the key will not exist in the object.<br>
		<br>
		All cards are from the latest Oracle text, not the original printed text (the 'extras' file has the originalText which is the non-oracle text).<br>

		<h1>JSONP<a href="#top">(back to top)</a></h1>
		<p>All JSON files are also available as JSONP files by changing the extension from '.json' to '.jsonp'.<br>
		<br>
		This allows you to include them client side by linking to them directly with a &lt;script&gt; tag.<br>
		<br>
		HTML Example: &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://mtgjson.com/json/AllSets.jsonp"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
		<br>
		A callback handler called 'mtgjsoncallback' will be called with 2 arguments.<br>
		<br>
		The first argument is the JSON data itself. This isn't a string, so no need to call JSON.parse()<br>
		<br>
		The second is the file name as a string, without an extension ("AllSets" in the example).<br>
		<br>
		Client side javascript exammple:<br>
		<pre><code data-language="javascript">        window.mtgjsoncallback = function(data, name)
        {~lb}
      		// handling code here
        {~rb};
</code></pre>
